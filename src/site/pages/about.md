# About Me

I'm a random Canadian living south of Ottawa near the St. Lawrence River. I spend my professional life bending technology to my will. I try to spend most of my free time with my family, and my time after the kids go to bed is either spent learning something or playing on my Xbox.

## About this site

I'm trying to contain most of the content that would be of a interest to a technology professional limited to my [professional site](https://www.andrewasquith.com), but there will definitely be some technology that I end up posting about here. 

Most other content will be whatever is of interest to me and hopefully you. I have a series of posts of things to do in Ontario, and a series of adventures of "Toys at Work"

Most content and imagery is mine and may not be reproduced or reused without my permission.

## About Toys at Work

One of my small joys the last several years has been the steady stream of toys my children provide me to take to work. I'm expected to take photos of their day and generally have a story to go along with them. While these stories are probably not of interest to anyone but my children, I'll be posting some for posterity.
