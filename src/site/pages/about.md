# About Me

I'm a random Canadian living south of Ottawa near the St. Lawrence River. I spend my professional life bending technology to my will. I try to spend most of my free time with my family, and my time after the kids go to bed is either spent learning something or playing on my Xbox.

## About this site

I'm trying to contain most of the content that would be of a interest to a technology professional limited to my [professional site](https://www.andrewasquith.com "Andrew Asquith - Technology Solutions"), but there will definitely be some technology that I end up posting about here.
