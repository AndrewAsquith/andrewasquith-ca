## Please read carefully so that you can understand how personal information that you provide to me is collected, used and disclosed.

This Privacy Policy applies to {{site.url}}. Your privacy is important to me and I will take all means possible to ensure that all personal information is kept private.

**Special Notice – if you are under 18 years old**
I do not intentionally collect personal data of persons under 18 years old. If you are under 18 years old please do not send your personal information (for example, your name, address or email address). If you are under 18 years old and you wish to ask a question or use this website in a manner which requires you to submit your personal information please have your parent or guardian do so on your behalf.

## What personal data I collect and why I collect it

### Embedded content from other websites
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website and is not something I have control over.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

{% if (analytics.google) -%}
### Analytics
I use Google Analytics for informational purposes about visitors. The following information may be collected during your visit:
- information about your computer, operating system and browser
- an [anonymized IP address](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052) and your computer’s approximate location
- what pages you visit on the site and what links you click on
- what site referred you here

You can opt out of this by using the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or configuring your browser to protect your privacy (e.g. by sending Do-Not-Track signals). Google also provides tools to manage your interactions with them, available through your account.

### How long I retain your data

### What rights you have over your data
I don't retain any of your data. However, if you believe that to be untrue, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data I hold about you, including any data you have provided. You can also request that I erase any personal data I hold about you. This does not include any data I am obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

### Where I send your data
