This post was originally going to look at the "big five" Canadian banks offerings for mobile devices; specifically their lack of native apps on Windows Phone and how their mobile sites compare. I may still write that article, but while I was researching a bit of small print on the CIBC website caught my eye.

Beneath the information for the iPhone, Android and BlackBerry there is a section for trademark information relating to Windows Phone, which is currently not mentioned elsewhere on the page. 

The CIBC page can be found [here](https://www.cibc.com/ca/how-to-bank/mobile.html "CIBC Mobile Banking Page"). Obviously this is not definitive, but as a Windows Phone owner I am hopeful.
