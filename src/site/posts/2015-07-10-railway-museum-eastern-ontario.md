The museum itself is the original train station and yard dating back to the early 1900s.
Admission is inexpensive, 2 adults + 2 children is $20. The museum is generally open from May to October, but for specific dates it is recommended to check the website.

The museum has a selection of train cars around the property, most of which you're able to enter and take a walk through. Several of the cars have exhibits setup inside, such as the dental car pictured here.
