The Bushplane Heritage Centre is housed in an old Hangar that was previously used for the Fire and Aviation division of the Ministry of Natural Resources. Because the centre is located in an actual hangar, the floorspace is quite considerable with a fair amount to do. As a plane enthusiast you could probably spend more time than most here inspecting every little detail, however most people will likely see and do everything they want in about 2 hours.

Admission to the centre is reasonable, with a family of four being approximately $40 Canadian, depending on the age of your children. The centre is open year round, except for some holidays, however it does operate with reduced hours during the fall and winter months.

One of the main attractions is obviously the aircraft themselves. While some are roped off, many are accessible and you're free to climb into them, check out the cockpit and cargo hold and generally walk in, around and under them.

As bushplanes had a substantial role in firefighting in the north, there is a large amount of information on fire fighting and prevention, including an exhibit with a fire tower you can climb providing a great view of the hangar, fire fighting gear that was used and a lightning strike recorder.


![Navigation Exhibit](/img/posts/bushplane-museum/bushplane-museum-1.jpg "Navigation Exhibit")


There are numerous stations around the space with hands on opportunities to learn. The stations include information on the various parts of the aircraft, such as navigation systems and how the engines work. There are also two small theatres that run a flight experience and wildfire fighting experience. 


As with most museums, group and school tours can be arranged, and if you're so inclined, you can even host your child's birthday party at the museum on the weekends. For everything the centre offers, check out their [website](http://www.bushplane.com/ "Canadian Bushplane Heritage Center")
