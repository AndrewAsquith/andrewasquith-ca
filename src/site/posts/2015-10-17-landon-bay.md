The Landon Bay Centre is part of the [Frontenac Arch Biosphere](https://www.frontenacarchbiosphere.ca/explore/walking-and-hiking-trails/hiking-trails/landon-bay-centre "Frontenac Arch Biosphere"). The centre itself is a 225 Acre Ecological Reserve just outside the town of Gananoque.

The main attraction are the hiking trails of low to moderate difficulty that will take you through meadows, marshlands, or to the top of the lookout providing an excellent view of the St. Lawrence River and surrounding area. There is also a wheelchair accessible trail for those who have mobility challenges but still like to get out and enjoy nature.

Aside from the hiking trails, there is a campground that operates during the summer months, several play structures, fire pits and picnic areas, and also seasonably available, a small store.


Outside of the regular season, the area is still accessible, although the main gate is normally closed adding about a five minute walk into the main area to your visit. Our preference has actually been to visit in the fall when the trees are showing off all their magnificent colours, which makes for a very picturesque walk up to the lookout. The trail to the lookout itself is fairly manageable, even for small children and takes about twenty minutes to reach the top.

Access to the grounds is free, although there are numerous donation boxes throughout at entrances to the main area as well as the start of the trails.
