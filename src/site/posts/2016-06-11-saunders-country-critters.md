The zoo and sanctuary is an apt description as there are both a variety of domestic and exotic wildlife present on site. The admission will cost a family of four about $40 Canadian, and a family can expect to easily spend an hour or two walking through checking out the wildlife. 

The walk through can either be entirely self-paced, or if your timing is good, you can take part in one of the feeding tours. During feeding time, staff will visit each enclosure in turn and while feeding the animals discuss them, their habitat and take questions.

There is a wide variety of wildlife present, many of which would be difficult to find elsewhere. The Zoo and Sanctuary was originally opened to the public by the owners in an effort to help finance the costs of caring for an increasing number of animals. The Sanctuary aspect comes from the fact that many of the animals, especially the exotic ones are those which have special needs and may in fact have been euthanized if a place like Saunders was unable to take them in. 

There are animals that have been injured in the wild, such as a one-eyed Lynx, or Birds of Prey that need rehabilitation as well as animals that people obviously thought would make good pets but then reconsidered. All the animals are well cared for, and the premises are licensed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.

On site, aside from the wide variety of wildlife, there is a small play structure for the children, as well as a sandbox with some toys near the picnic tables provided should you want to pack a lunch. There is also a Chip Truck if you spent longer than anticipated and didn't bring any food. If you want to feed some of the animals, the small gift shop offers ice cream cones of feed you can dole out to those animals that are interested.
