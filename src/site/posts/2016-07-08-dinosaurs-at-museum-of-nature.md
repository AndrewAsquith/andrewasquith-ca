Dinosaurs are a favourite of many children and adult alike, and the [Museum of Nature](https://nature.ca "Museum of Nature") in Ottawa is the place to go if you want to know more about these prehistoric creatures.

The Museum of Nature in Ottawa is located just North of the Queensway in Ottawa and has a substantial amount of parking on site include charging stations for electric vehicles. The admission to the museum will cost about $50 Canadian for a family of four, although passes may be available at your local library that will reduce or eliminate that cost. Additional special exhibits are frequently running, which will cost the average family approximately $30 Canadian on top of the general admission.

The big draw at the time we went was a secondary special exhibit further showcasing dinosaurs in addition to the full time exhibit on fossils. This time limited exhibit was an entire second area dedicated to dinosaurs and fossils that are not part of the general exhibit and admission and was worth the additional admission fees. The fully assembled fossils were impressive in size and scale and the staff manning the exhibit were both helpful and enthusiastic engaging patrons and encouraging getting hands on with some of the fossils.

As the museum of nature is much more than just the dinosaurs, the other exhibits are equally as impressive and worth exploring while you're visiting. There is a water exhibit featuring a giant whale skeleton. The exhibit includes a selection of both hands-on activities such a mock underwater vehicle, and the learning activities you'd expect from a museum.  Other permanent exhibits include one on mammals as well as one on the Canadian Arctic.
