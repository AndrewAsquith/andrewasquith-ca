The [St. Lawrence Parks Commission](http://http://www.stlawrenceparks.com/ "St. Lawrence Parks Commission")  have a series of three [campgrounds](http://www.stlawrenceparks.com/camping/campgrounds/long-sault-parkway/ "Long Sault Parkway Campgrounds") along the Long Sault Parkway. The parkway itself runs amongst 11 small islands that are made from the high points of land which survived the flooding of the seaway. The water is fairly well sheltered from the larger St. Lawrence waterway, making it a popular spot for divers and boaters.

The campgrounds are open from May until Thanksgiving. There are a variety of sites for seasonal, tent (un-serviced) and both partial (15amp only) and full service. The park facilities are all generally well kept. The beaches are regularly groomed, the sites are typically well mowed with trees and shrubs maintained, and the washrooms are cleaned every couple of hours. 

Not all of the campgrounds have a beach as part of the campground directly, however there are two large beaches that are along the parkway which you get acccess to a camper. You can also buy separate day-passes for access to the beach if you're in the area but not staying at the campgrounds. Camp sites range in price from approximately $35 to $70 per night, depending on which campground and what services.

The campgrounds also offer Camper Cabins for a little under $100 per night. The cabins have electricity and a small fridge and microwave, but bathroom and showers do require a trip to the campground facilities. There is also a bbq with propane provided. The cabins have a queen bed and a set of bunk beds, making them an ideal option for the family of four.

Because the campgrounds are on the islands, a fair number of the campsites are directly on the water, which makes it easy to drop in your canoe or go for a quick swim right from your site. There are also numerous attractions in the area such as Upper Canada Village and the Migratory Bird Sanctuary.

The campgrounds have playstructures to keep the kids entertained, picnic areas and places to fish. They also have a general store where you can pick up amenities that you may have forgotten or run out of, as well as firewood, ice cream and if necessary, there's even a Keurig you can use.
