[Smyths Orchard](http://www.smythsapples.com/ "Smyth's apple orchard") is the home of the McIntosh Red Apple. The orchard got it's beginnings in the mid-1800s. All the McIntosh orchards around the world are actually descendant of the single tree that McIntosh found on his farm in the early 1800s. The original tree produced fruit until 1906, and Smyth's Orchard is arguably the most authentic "Mac" you can get, being just down the road.

Like any orchard, the main draw of Smyth's is the ability to pick your own. There are a wide variety of apples grown any given year, including the McIntosh, Granny Smith, Lobo and Honey Crisp. The exact varieties available obviously depend on mother nature.

The store on site offers a selection of "professionally picked" apples of different varieties, but there's also a lot more to choose from. Jams, Chutneys, and a variety of apple infused baked goods like muffins and tarts are available. There are also gift baskets, both pre-assembled and the ability to pick and choose what you'd like in it. If for some reason apples aren't your thing, you're probably in the wrong spot, but plums, pears and other fruits and vegetables can also be had seasonally.

While there are many orchards where you can pick your own, few have the heritage that Smyth's does. The owners live on the property and you can normally find 2 or 3 generations of them working on any given day. They're always extremely friendly and helpful, and of course quite happy to share some history if you ask.

The Orchard and store are only open seasonally, so it's best to call ahead to make sure. For more about the orchard and to check if they're open, please visit the [website](http://www.smythsapples.com/ "Smyth's apple orchard").
