Local car shows and gatherings have been around as long as cars themselves. They provide a chance for owners and the public to come together and enjoy the automobile culture that is pervasive in North America.

In contrast to commercial car shows that debut new models and have representation from manufacturers, the local car show is a much more personal experience, with owners showing off their prize possessions and talking to other afficionados about their vehicles.

Many of the owners of the cars will belong to local car clubs, who are the ones that typically arrange these more official gatherings, compared to the weeknight parking lot convergence you may have encountered. Because these are more official events they tend to happen once a year in a given town and have processes for juding cars in different categories. They may also include a few activities such as a barbecue and face painting for the kids, as they can draw large crowds.

The owners that are in the clubs tend to have more unique vehicles and may visit a few of these events during the summer months, so they frequently have extra touches, such as displays of model cars or additional information about their vehicle posted to stand out a little.

Generally the organizers are accepting of anyone that wants to show off their vehicle, even if they're not a club member, and in more rural areas it's not uncommon for people to travel a short distance to show off their cars and trucks at these larger gatherings.

The vehicles on display are typically of the more antique and classic varieties. From the original model A to the popular muscle cars of the 70s and everything in between. 

That's not to say you can't find more contemporary vehicles present. Newer generation sports cars also frequently make an appearance. Modern Mustangs and Corvettes continue to be quite popular, along with generally rarer and more expensive vehicles like a Lamborghini or a Porsche.

Because these events are organized by local car clubs and people, your best bet for finding one is check local news papers, websites, or contact any car clubs in your area.
