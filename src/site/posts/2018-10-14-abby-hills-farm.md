While Abby Hill Farms is open most of the growing season to sell their fresh fruits and vegetables, every Thanksgiving the grounds are turned into a mini-fair. The event is not on the same scale as the agricultural fairs of the various towns and counties, but it is an enjoyable experience and a family can easily spend a couple of hours on a fall afternoon.

Aside from a plethora of pumpkins and other seasonal fruits and vegetables, the thanksgiving activities include numerous things for kids to do. There is a mini train that will take you around the grounds, which is a short approximately 5 minute ride. There is a bouncy castle that is always popular with kids, along with a few small games for kids to partake in. 

Near the back of the area is a large dirt mound with several drainage pipes making tunnels for the kids to climb in and through and proves almost as popular as climbing through the impressive mounds of pumpkins.


![Petting Zoo](/img/posts/abby-hill-farms/abby-hill-farms-3.jpg "Petting Zoo")


There is also a small petting zoo setup, containing standard farm livestock. Some years there is another area with some more exotic animals being brought in by other local attractions such as [Saunders Country Critters](/posts/saunders-country-critters/ "Saunders Country Critters"). 

A few magic shows are normally run over the course of the event in the tent by a local magician and are always good for a laugh, for both parents and children alike. 

While not a full day excursion, it's close enough to you if you live in Ottawa that it's worth the visit, especially if you're in the market for a pumpkin. For more information about Abby Hill Farms, please visit their [website](https://www.abbyhillfarms.com/ "Abby Hill Farms").
